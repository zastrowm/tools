"""
Advanced recursive thinking tool for Strands Agent.

This module provides functionality for deep analytical thinking through multiple recursive cycles,
enabling sophisticated thought processing, learning, and self-reflection capabilities.
The tool processes thoughts through sequential cycles, each building upon the previous,
to generate progressively refined insights.

Usage with Strands Agent:
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import think, stop

agent = Agent(tools=[think, stop])

# Basic usage with default system prompt
result = agent.tool.think(
    thought="How might we improve renewable energy storage solutions?",
    cycle_count=3,
    system_prompt="You are an expert energy systems analyst."
)

# Advanced usage with custom system prompt
result = agent.tool.think(
    thought="Analyze the implications of quantum computing on cryptography.",
    cycle_count=5,
    system_prompt="You are a specialist in quantum computing and cryptography. Analyze this topic deeply,
    considering both technical and practical aspects."
)
```

See the think function docstring for more details on configuration options and parameters.

    """
    Recursive thinking tool for sophisticated thought generation, learning, and self-reflection.

    This tool implements a multi-cycle cognitive analysis approach that progressively refines thoughts
    through iterative processing. Each cycle builds upon insights from the previous cycle,
    creating a depth of analysis that would be difficult to achieve in a single pass.

    How It Works:
    ------------
    1. The tool processes the initial thought through a specified number of thinking cycles
    2. Each cycle uses the output from the previous cycle as a foundation for deeper analysis
    3. A specialized system prompt guides the thinking process toward specific expertise domains
    4. Each cycle's output is captured and included in the final comprehensive analysis
    5. The tool avoids recursive self-calls and encourages the use of other tools when appropriate

    Thinking Process:
    ---------------
    - First cycle processes the original thought directly with the provided system prompt
    - Each subsequent cycle builds upon the previous cycle's output
    - Cycles are tracked and labeled clearly in the output
    - The process creates a chain of progressive refinement and deeper insights
    - Final output includes the complete thought evolution across all cycles

    Common Usage Scenarios:
    ---------------------
    - Problem analysis: Breaking down complex problems into manageable components
    - Idea development: Progressively refining creative concepts
    - Learning exploration: Generating questions and insights about new domains
    - Strategic planning: Developing multi-step approaches to challenges
    - Self-reflection: Analyzing decision processes and potential biases

    Args:
        thought: The detailed thought or idea to process through multiple thinking cycles.
            This can be a question, statement, problem description, or creative prompt.
        cycle_count: Number of thinking cycles to perform (1-10). More cycles allow for
            deeper analysis but require more time and resources. Typically 3-5 cycles
            provide a good balance of depth and efficiency.
        system_prompt: Custom system prompt to use for the LLM thinking process. This should
            specify the expertise domain and thinking approach for processing the thought.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying LLM processing.

    Returns:
        Dict containing status and response content in the format:
        {
            "status": "success|error",
            "content": [{"text": "Detailed thinking output across all cycles"}]
        }

        Success case: Returns concatenated results from all thinking cycles
        Error case: Returns information about what went wrong during processing

    Notes:
        - Higher cycle counts provide deeper analysis but consume more resources
        - The system_prompt significantly influences the thinking style and domain expertise
        - For complex topics, more specific system prompts tend to yield better results
        - The tool is designed to avoid recursive self-calls that could cause infinite loops
        - Each cycle has visibility into previous cycle outputs to enable building upon insights
